#The settings file for CABS (Connection Automation/Brokerage System)
#These settings are usually only set once for a whole system, by the installer, be careful editing this document.
#For greater security, we recommend you choose unique ports for your system.
#To change other settings, use the CABS web interface.
#Settings set in the CABS web interface override this file's settings.
#Syntax requires the variable name be separated from the value with ':\t' (colon and a tab)

##Max Clients

##Use Agent
#Specifies whether or not to use Agents on the machines in the machine pools
#Agents listen to user connections, with the same username that is used to connect to the system

Auto_Max:	300

##LDAP or Active Directory Server

##Log_Amount
#This is how much output is written out in the logs, from 0 - 4.
#4 is full debug, 0 is none. 3 is a good amount.
