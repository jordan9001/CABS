Information on how to update/distribute CABS
create_installers
    The top level holds a script called create_installers that will work on a unix machine, and will create the installers needed for the other systems.
    This is a python script that uses the curses library.
    It is built with pyinstaller to be an executable

Source holds all of CABS, and their source files. In some of the subdirectories there are build folders which contain executables or os specific installation files.
    create_installers knows where to find these.
    if these need to be updated to match the source code:
        The windows executables were created with pyinstaller on a windows machine
        The windows installers were created with the .nsi files, using NSIS
        The linux executables were created with pyinstaller on a linux machine
        The linux installers are just bash scripts
